**⚠️ Development Notice**

 This application is currently under active development and is **not production-ready**. Please use this for learning, development, and testing purposes only. Want to contribute? We'd love your help! Check out our [contribution guidelines](#-contributing) below to get started.

## 🚀 Philosophy

**Payment integration shouldn't be complicated.**

We believe every developer should be able to collect money with just a few lines of code, without being locked into a single payment provider. Our mission is to create a unified, vendor-agnostic payment integration that works seamlessly with any payment gateway while maintaining simplicity and flexibility.

No webhook handling, no customer creation, no subscription management.

### Core Principles

- **Developer First**: Minimal setup, maximum functionality
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Switch between payment providers without rewriting your entire payment system
- **Unified API**: One interface for all payment gateways
- **Production Ready**: Built with best practices and extensive testing

## ✨ Features

- 🔌 **Multiple Payment Gateways**: Currently support for PayPal and Stripe (more soon)
- 📊 **Subscription Management**: Handle recurring payments effortlessly
- 💳 **One-time Payments**: Simple integration for single transactions
- 🎯 **Plan Management**: Dynamic subscription plan handling
- 🔐 **Secure by Design**: Use security best practices
- 🧪 **Fully Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage with Pest
- 📖 **Well Documented**: Clear documentation and examples (soon)
- 🌐 **API First**: RESTful API for headless implementations
